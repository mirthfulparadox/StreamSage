# 🎧 StreamSage – AI/NLP Pipeline for Streaming Sentiment Analysis

**StreamSage** is a Python-based AI/NLP project that analyzes real-world user reviews from streaming platforms (like Netflix, Hotstar, etc.) to uncover sentiment, key experience themes, and actionable insights.

It combines classical NLP with modern LLM-driven techniques to decode user satisfaction, pain points, and trends — giving streaming businesses the insights they need to retain and grow users.

---

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Extract & analyze sentiment from thousands of real user reviews.
- Identify dominant topics driving user praise or frustration.
- Visualize trends over time to understand shifts in user perception.
- Incorporate LLM-based techniques for summarization and insight generation.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- ✅ Cleaned & preprocessed real-world review datasets
- ✅ Sentiment analysis using VADER/TextBlob & LLM-based approaches (e.g., OpenAI/transformers)
- ✅ Topic modeling with LDA / BERTopic
- ✅ Dashboard showcasing user emotion trends & dominant themes
- ✅ Modular Python pipeline, ready for expansion & integration
